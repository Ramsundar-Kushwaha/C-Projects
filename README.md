# 🏦 Console-Based Banking System in C++

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **console-based banking application** developed using **C++** for educational and study purposes. The system simulates essential banking operations such as account registration, login, balance deposit, withdrawal, and viewing current balance. It uses file handling for persistent data storage and incorporates basic input validation and error handling.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. On launch, the user can either **sign up** or **log in**.
2. Once logged in:

   * Select options to deposit, withdraw, or check balance.
   * All transactions are saved to separate text files under the user's name.
3. User can **exit safely**, which will also be recorded in their transaction history.
